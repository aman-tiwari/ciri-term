Terminal for Wizardhacks.

To start, double click on `start-osx.command` or run in a terminal `./start-osx.command` (or `./node index.js`)

You have to be focused on the **Unity** window to type into the terminal.

The niceness of the colours in the terminal depends on your default terminal theme, try using one of the Solarized Dark themes or somesuch.
